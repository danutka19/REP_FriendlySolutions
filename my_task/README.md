Please take a look for my homework's task. It consists of three components. 
You can find also flexbox (I use it as CSS file and also as React Native in both way).
About Json data which you send me, unfortunately I have to remove first line ("exec_time": 0.11) because JSON showed as the mistake/ bug.
I hope that in spite of it, Table will be readable.
Thanking in advance

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
There is also used json data, so localhost can be changed for 3001.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
